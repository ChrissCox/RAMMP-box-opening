"""The gripper's empty-close reading, learned (runtime/fingers).

Bench 2026-09-25: after the arm driver restarted, a close on nothing read
0.636 instead of 0.793 — the fingertips visibly shut in the wrist frames
either way. The mission's close found them already shut, "never moved", and
it refused to press three runs running."""
