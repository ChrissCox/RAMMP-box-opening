"""Which way round a continuous joint is written (runtime/branches).

Bench 2026-09-25: the arm turned joint_3 a full circle (4.7 s) on its way
to a box on the left. At HOME joint_3 sits at 3.142, a hair past +pi, and
the transport reports it wrapped: -3.1411 that day. The planner, which
bounds the joint at +/-6.0 rad and plans between the numbers it is given,
went from -3.14 to the +3.x its IK solution sat on — the long way round."""
