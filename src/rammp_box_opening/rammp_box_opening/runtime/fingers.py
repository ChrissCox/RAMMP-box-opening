"""Where THIS gripper's knuckle reads when the fingers are shut on nothing.

The mission always commands a full close (GRIPPER_CMD_CLOSED, the driver's
setpoint 1.0); what the knuckle then reads is the gripper's business, and it
changed: 0.793 through 2026-09-25 11:50, 0.636 after the arm driver restarted
at 14:04 — the fingertips visibly pressed together in the wrist frames both
before and after, and RAMMP-generalized's runtime measured the same "the empty
gripper closes at 0.636 rad" on its own. A close that finds the fingers
already shut at 0.636 never moves and never reaches 0.8, so the mission
refused to press with its fingers closed, three runs running.

So the reading of an empty close is learned from the mission's own touch
(the fingers are shut in free air then; learn_closed) and kept in the state
dir, and "already closed" and the grip band follow it (scaled_band: the
band was measured against the 0.793 reading, and this change scaled every
reading alike). With nothing learned, the 0.793 it was measured at; the
bench's state dir holds 0.636 from the day it changed.
