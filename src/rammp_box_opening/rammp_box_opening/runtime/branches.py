"""Which way round a continuous joint is written.

The Gen3's joints 1, 3, 5 and 7 turn without end (both URDF limits
infinite). The arm's transport reports them wrapped into (-pi, pi]
(kinova-gen3-driver kortex_transport.cpp), and the driver compares every
target with the measurement the short way round — to the ARM, q and
q + 2*pi are one angle. Not to the planner: cuRobo bounds them as plain
revolute joints at +/-6.0 rad and plans the straight line between the
numbers it is handed. HOME holds joint_3 at 3.142, a hair past +pi, so at
HOME it reads -3.1411 some days and +3.1413 on others; handed -3.1411, the
planner turned joint_3 six radians — a full circle, 4.7 s — to reach a box
on the left of the table (bench 2026-09-25). Whatever hands a live reading
to the planner, or lines one up against a planned path, writes it on the
right branch first.
