"""What box-opening holds true about the kinova-gen3-ros2 driver.

The planner-side executor this repo drove before (RAMMP-CuRobo
feat/perceived-world, executor.py) refused a goal unless the arm stood at
its first waypoint, its velocities sat under the URDF limits and its time
ran forward, and it dilated time by a speed_scale. The driver's
/execute_joint_trajectory does none of that: its executor samples the
trajectory from t=0 and commands the first waypoint at once, wherever the
arm is, and the ROS layer checks only that every point carries seven
positions (kinova-gen3-driver v1.0.0 trajectory_executor.cpp,
kinova-gen3-ros2 ros2_backend.cpp). So those gates run here, in front of
every goal, and the driver's result codes, gripper units and middleware
are translated in one place.
