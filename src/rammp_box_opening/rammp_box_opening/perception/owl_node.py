"""owl_detector — persistent local bbox service for the semantic gate.

    ros2 run rammp_box_opening owl_detector

The OWL model costs tens of seconds to load, and a CLI that loads it per
run makes every mission wait (field 2026-09-01: the detect phase sat on
the preload). This node loads ONCE — at launch, overlapping the
planner's own GPU init — then runs the detector on the live colour
stream at a gentle cadence and publishes the best bbox:

    /rammp_box_opening/owl_bbox   std_msgs/Float32MultiArray
                                  [x0, y0, x1, y1, score, frame_age_s]

Published only when something clears vlm.owl_min_score; the stamp is the
FRAME time so the mission can ignore stale sightings. Inference runs only
while the mission has enabled it (a latched Bool on owl_enable, auto-off
after 30 s): outside its detect windows the node heartbeats and leaves
the GPU to the planner. This is the architecture the deployment target
wants: an always-on perception service whose output the mission consumes.

Queries, model, and threshold come from the same container YAML the
mission uses (`container` parameter), so there is exactly one place to
tune them.
