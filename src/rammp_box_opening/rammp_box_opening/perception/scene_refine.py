"""Refining the scene camera's calibration from what the wrist measured.

Every staging run records one pair: where the scene camera put the button
top and where the wrist's aim found it, both in base_link (press_demo
record_residual). The pairs are the calibration's own residuals, and a
rigid correction fitted to them is the refinement — no marker, no motion.

With few pairs, or pairs all at one spot, only a translation is
identifiable; a rotation needs pairs spread over the table (>= 4, spanning
>= 0.15 m). The fit says which it did.

The correction is HORIZONTAL: x, y and a turn about the vertical. The
scene camera's box-top height is not the arm's — with the calibration
fitted to put the table exactly at its surveyed height and level, the pink
lid still read ~3 cm low (2026-09-24) — so a 3-D fit to the pairs tilts
the table to chase it. Height and tilt belong to the table plane the scene
camera sees every run, not to the pairs.

A pair measures the calibration it was recorded under, and no other: once
a correction is written, the pairs it was fitted from describe a camera
that no longer exists (calibrated_at, load_pairs' `since`).
