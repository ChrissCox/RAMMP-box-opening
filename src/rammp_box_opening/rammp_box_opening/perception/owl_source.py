"""Local open-vocabulary bbox: OWLv2 on the Jetson, no network in the loop.

The wheelchair will not always have internet (deployment constraint,
2026-09-01), so the semantic gate needs a local answer. OWLv2 runs in the
persistent owl_detector node (perception/owl_node.py); this module is the
mission side: the enable gate, the topic rung, and the pure helpers.

Measured on capture 20260901-130610 (8 scan-pose frames): bbox stable to
+/-1 px across frames, centred on the true box, score 0.235-0.249
against a 0.12-0.18 false-positive floor. Phrasing matters more than the
model: "a small white square box" finds it, "a food storage container"
does not — which is why the queries are CONFIG, plural, and the best
score across them wins.

Same contract and the same humility as the Claude backend: a returned
roi only ever NARROWS where the depth detector looks; every geometric
honesty gate still stands behind it. There is deliberately NO in-process
model: a cold load costs tens of seconds against a 10 s detect budget and
parked a second OWLv2 on the planner's GPU (review 2026-09-02).
