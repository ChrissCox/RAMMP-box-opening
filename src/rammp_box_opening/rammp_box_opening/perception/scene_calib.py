"""Where the scene camera stands, in the arm's frame.

The calibration bridges the two cameras through things they both see. The
wrist camera is already calibrated to the arm (config/camera_d405_wrist.yaml)
and sees the cabinet tag from HOME at 30 cm, so it can place the tag and
the door it is stuck to in base_link. The scene camera sees the same tag,
the same door and the table. From those:

  rotation     the door normal and the table normal, seen in both frames.
               Two big planes, thousands of points each — a reference the
               tag itself cannot give, being 32 pixels wide in the scene
               camera (its pose flips between mirror solutions, 34 deg of
               scatter measured 2026-09-16).
  translation  the tag centre: a pixel ray meeting the door plane, on both
               sides. No dependence on the printed tag size, which the
               label on the wall gets wrong (50 mm claimed, 57-58 mm by
               four depth readings).

Consistency is checked, not assumed: the angle between the door and the
table must agree between the two frames, or the calibration is refused.

Pure numpy here; the ROS grabbing lives in scripts/calibrate_scene_camera.py.
