"""The look: pointing the camera at the table before anything is known.

A turn, not a flight. Measured on the real planner from HOME (2026-09-15):
flying to the old fixed scan pose 3.89 s, re-orienting the tool in place
without travelling 4.01 s — both swing about 3 rad, because wrist-flat and
tool-down are different IK families — against 3.42 s for this, which moves
two joints. Defined against the arm's OWN rest pose rather than a bench
Cartesian pose, so it holds wherever the chair is standing.

WHAT MUST BE IN FRAME IS THE BOX TOP, not the table, and the whole of it:
the top sits dims.z nearer the camera, so it is seen through a
proportionally smaller window, and a top touching the image border is
refused (depth_source's border gate) because a clipped footprint cannot be
measured. Sizing the look by what it sees of the TABLE is how the first
field run missed a box (2026-09-15: the box stood at base [0.48, 0.12], the
look's lid-height frame reached x 0.55, and the top's far edge at 0.54 left
10 mm — the semantic model found it jammed against the frame edge while the
plateau geometry found nothing in 234 frames).

From HOME this puts the camera at [0.49, 0.00, 0.479] looking straight
down. At LID height the frame covers x 0.28-0.71 and y +/-0.38 (TF,
2026-09-15); the NARROW axis is x, because the image's long axis lies along
base y. With the sweep below that covers the placement band.

The lift does two jobs. Turning the wrist alone leaves the fingertips at
z 0.154 — above the pre-detection keep-out band (top z 0.105), but inside
cuRobo's collision activation distance, and the goal is refused outright
(IK_FAIL, live planner 2026-09-15: refused at lift 0.00 and 0.10, solved
from 0.15 up). Past that, every further radian of lift buys view. Turning
the wrist by the same amount again keeps the camera pointing straight
down, so the view stays nadir — the geometry the plateau is measured in.
